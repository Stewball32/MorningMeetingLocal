# Morning Meeting

**Morning Meeting** is a local-network "web" app for running interactive classroom presentations, tracking attendance, and showcasing student/teacher info. Built with modern tools for easy local hosting and fast iteration.

## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [SvelteKit 5](https://kit.svelte.dev/) + [Skeleton UI v3](https://www.skeleton.dev/) + [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/)
- **Local Dev:** Runs on Raspberry Pi or other local hardware
- **Current Enviroment**: Currently supporting Node/NPM LTS (currently 22.14.0)

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

- `/animotion/`: Main SvelteKit project ("Animotion") for presentation frontend
- `/pocketbase/`: PocketBase backend for storing and managing student/teacher data

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stewball32/MorningMeetingLocal.git
cd MorningMeetingLocal
```

### 2. Run Setup Script

#### For Linux/macOS:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

#### For Windows:
```powershell
setup.bat
```

This script will:
- Download the correct PocketBase binary based on your OS/architecture
- Optionally restore sample data to `pb_data/`
- Create `.env` file in `animotion/` if it doesn't exist
- Run `npm install` in `animotion/`

Config options can be modified in `setup.env` before running the script.

### 3. Dev Scripts

After setup:
- Start the frontend in dev mode:
  ```bash
	cd animotion
  npm run dev
  ```

- Start the frontend in production preview mode:
  ```bash
	npm run build
  npm run preview
  ```
- Test/Run on network by adding `host` at the end:
	```bash
	npm run devhost
	npm run previewhost
	```

- Start PocketBase manually:
  ```bash
	cd pocketbase
  ./pocketbase serve
  ```

	Test/Run on Network by adding --http or --https (0.0.0.0 will accept all connections)
	```bash
	./pocketbase serve --http=0.0.0.0

### 4. Use the PocketBase UI

Visit: [http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/](http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/)
- Create an admin account
- Add `students` and `teachers` in their respective tables
	- setup scripts will add sample teachers and students if you said yes.

## ðŸ§  Future Plans

- Custom UI for managing student data
- More interactivity for slides
- Remote control / cast view mode
