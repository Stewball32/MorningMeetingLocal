# Morning Meeting

**Morning Meeting** is a local-first web app for running interactive classroom presentations, tracking attendance, and showcasing student/teacher info. Built with modern tools for easy local hosting and fast iteration.

## üß± Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [SvelteKit 5](https://kit.svelte.dev/) + [Skeleton UI v3](https://www.skeleton.dev/) + [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/)
- **Local Dev:** Runs on Raspberry Pi or other local hardware

## üì¶ Project Structure

- `/animotion/`: Main SvelteKit project ("Animotion") for presentation frontend
- `/pocketbase/`: PocketBase backend for storing and managing student/teacher data

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stewball32/MorningMeetingLocal.git
cd MorningMeetingLocal
```

### 2. Setup PocketBase

#### For Linux/macOS:

```bash
cd pocketbase
./pocketbase-linux serve
```

#### For Windows:

Rename the binary to `pocketbase.exe` and run:

```powershell
cd pocketbase
./pocketbase serve
```

If you're having trouble, try downloading [a difference v0.26.2 version](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.26.6) of PocketBase if needed and run it from the `pocketbase/` folder.

Then open your browser to the local PocketBase web UI (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/`) and:

- Log in as admin
- Create collections for `students` and `teachers`
- Add your data manually or via CSV import

### 3. Setup the Frontend

```bash
cd ../animotion
cp .env.example .env
# Make sure the .env file points to your local PocketBase instance

npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Build Frontend for Production

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

#### 4.1 View Production

```bash
npm run preview
```

## üß† Future Plans

- Custom UI for managing student data
- More interactivity for slides
- Remote control / cast view mode
